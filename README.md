# Geostatistical simulation of hydraulic head and its derivatives

An example demonstrating how sequential gaussian simulation can be used to simulate hydraulic head and its partial derivatives. Subsequently, the derivatives can be used to assess the concavity and locations of extrema in the hydraulic head surface.
